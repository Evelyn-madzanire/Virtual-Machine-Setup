# Home Lab: Ubuntu Server VM on VMware

## About
This repository documents my **personal home lab setup** using **VMware** and **Ubuntu Server**.  
It includes step-by-step instructions, screenshots, and configurations for creating a virtual machine for learning, testing, and experimentation.

## Purpose
- Learn Ubuntu Server administration.  
- Test networking, services, and server configurations in a safe environment.  
- Build a portfolio of home lab projects.

## Prerequisites
- VMware Workstation/Player installed.  
- Ubuntu Server ISO downloaded.  
- At least 2 GB RAM and 20 GB disk space for the VM.

## VM Setup Overview
1. **Create a new VM in VMware** (assign resources, select ISO).  
2. **Install Ubuntu Server** (configure network, users, and packages).  
3. **Post-installation setup** (update packages, install VMware tools).  
4. **Optional configurations** for home lab experiments (e.g., OpenSSH, web server, monitoring).

## Screenshots & Documentation
*Screenshots of each key step are included in `/screenshots` folder.*

## Next Steps
- Add more VMs to simulate a full network environment.  
- Experiment with services, monitoring, and security tools.  
- Document lessons learned and troubleshooting steps.
